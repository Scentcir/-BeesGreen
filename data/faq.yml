  - question: Do I need to clean my components?
    answer: Normally no cleaning is required as long as the modules are installed at an adequate angle (at least 15°) (modules are self-cleaning by rainwater). Regular maintenance is recommended to remove fecal contamination. If the module is fouled, it can be cleaned early in the morning or late in the evening with a soft tool (e.g. sponge) and water. Do not scrape the feces, as this may cause scratches to the glass.
